XFS combines advanced journaling technology with full 64-bit
addressing and scalable structures and algorithms.

+ Journaled 64-bit filesystem with guaranteed filesystem consistency.

+ XFS supports filesystem growth for mounted volumes, allows
filesystem "freeze" and "thaw" operations to support volume level
snapshots, and provides an online file defragmentation utility.

+ XFS supports user and group quotas.  XFS considers quota information
as filesystem metadata and uses journaling to avoid the need for
lengthy quota consistency checks after a crash.

+ For Linux 2.6 and beyond, when using 64 bit addressing in the block
devices layer (CONFIG_LBD) and a 64 bit platform, filesystem size
limit increases to 9 million terabytes (or the device limits).  For
these later kernels on 32 bit platforms, 16TB is the current limit
even with 64 bit addressing enabled in the block layer.

This package contains filesystem manipulation and support programs.
