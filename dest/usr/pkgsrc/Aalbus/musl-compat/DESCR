A set of headers and small utilities for use on musl libc systems, for providing some minimal glibc compatibility.

Some of these things are taken from Alpine Linux's musl package.

libintl.a is provided so that programs which specify -lintl when linking don't fail, but use musl's libintl implementation anyway. musl itself uses the same method for libm, librt, libpthread, libcrypt...
