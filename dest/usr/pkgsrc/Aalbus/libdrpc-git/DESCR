libdrpc

What is it?
This is a port of Android librpc to more regular libc versions 
(should build with musl, uclibc, or (e)glibc; klibc and dietlibc might work).
It needs <linux/poll.h> for POLLRDHUP; at this point musl does not define 
this macro under any condition, and Android <poll.h> uses <linux/poll.h>.

partwake.c, which is not built, contains partial wakelock support.
If you want this, you will need to port libpower.

Why?
The standard solution for RPC outside libc, libtirpc, really isn't:
it expects several headers in rpcsvc/ that it doesn't provide, and needs NIS.
The build system is enough of a maze that it was faster to port librpc from 
Android than to fish the proper code out of glibc and patch it into libtirpc.
