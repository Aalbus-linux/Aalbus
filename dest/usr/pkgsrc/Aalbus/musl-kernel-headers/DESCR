sabotage's linux kernel headers

linux headers are often broken for userspace, and downloading the entire kernel tarball just to get the headers is overkill.

thus we provide our own copy for the archs supported by sabotage.

some minor issues are fixed, plus libc-compat.h is patched to offer the same level of support for musl libc as the vanilla headers offer for glibc.
